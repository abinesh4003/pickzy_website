The software engineers at PickZy are more experienced and capable than any other firm. But, the thing we value most about PickZy is the get-the-job-done mentality instilled by the company President. PickZy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help us meet really tight deadlines. They work odd hours to accomodate our needs. And, they do what it takes to get the job done. I'm SO glad we discovered PickZy! In a nutshell, PickZy does a really good job of trying to understand the big picture and deliver solutions. Rather than simply providing a high quality software development service, PickZy strives to understand your goals and objectives and help you achieve them. They're more of a software development partner. I highly recommend PickZy Software.",

We were very impressed with the speed with which you were able to get the cryptographic functions of the app written in Objective C to interoperate with our back end code written in C#. That seemed like it was going to be a difficult task. Everyone at PickZy has been easy to communicate with and all business transactions (delivering code, accepting payments, etc.) have been very fair.
